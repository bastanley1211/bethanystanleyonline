    <h1>Music</h1>
<p>I have been writing music since I was about eight years old, playing guitar since 11, and started singing and performing around that time as well. It's almost been 20 years! I have sang in gospel, concert, and jazz choirs and received professional training in classical and opera stylings. I have sang in church music bands for about as long as I started learning guitar.</p>
<p>Over the years, sharing the music I wrote was a struggle. Partly because I could never finish anything, but a lot of it due to feelings of inadequacy. It was not until I was 24 years old that I went to my first open mic night and shared some original music.
  I enjoyed being a part of the Sacramento Songwriter Circle and songwriter community for a couple of years in a casual manner, but also playing paid gigs when opportunities arose. I frequented The Fig Tree: Coffee, Art, and Music Lounge in Roseville, California. There, the owner saw me play at their open mic and invited me to play a gig there. This period in my life my fun and
  invigorating. 
</p>
<p>It was there that I realized that I had no desire to be an "artist". I didn't want to be hemmed in creatively, and be branded. I just wanted to create music I fancied, no matter if there was variety, and also enjoy the experience of sharing music and performing - which for me was about connecting with others in my community. 
  When I got married and moved states, things fell to the wayside, but I didn't miss shows as much as I wanted to just make music and enjoy performing with and for others.
</p>

    <p>I am currently on a music haitus as I am having children and nurturing babies, but here is some of the music that I was putting out before all that started!</p>
    <p>I feel as if I have changed so much, and my heart has healed so much that the music feels very distant now, both thematically and sound-wise. I look forward to making new music that represents my life and thoughts now after years have passed.</p>
